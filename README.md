## Description
Created an interactive game with dynamically updated HTML through jQuery. The player is attempting to use four buttons with randomly assigned values to add up to and match a randomly determined value. However, to make things tricky, the value of each of the four buttons is hidden. I changed the theme of the game to Bob's Burgers with each button representing a certain number of burgers being used to feed Teddy.
